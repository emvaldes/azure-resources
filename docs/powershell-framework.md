### Azure CLI Cross-Platform
These two approaches achieve similar results (retrieving Azure resource IDs), but they differ in execution, environment, and performance. Let's break down the differences:

##### **1. `$resources = az resources list --query "[].{id:id}" --output json | ConvertFrom-Json`**

#### **What It Does:**
- Runs the Azure CLI command `az resources list`, which retrieves a list of Azure resources.
- Uses the `--query` parameter to filter only the `id` of each resource.
- Outputs the result in JSON format using `--output json`.
- Pipes the JSON output into PowerShell's `ConvertFrom-Json` cmdlet to convert it into a PowerShell object.

#### **Pros:**
1. **Lightweight:** Azure CLI is optimized for cross-platform environments, and this approach directly uses it.
2. **Cross-Platform:** The Azure CLI (`az`) works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it more portable for multi-OS setups.
3. **JMESPath Querying:** The `--query` parameter in the Azure CLI uses JMESPath syntax, which is powerful for filtering and formatting data.
4. **Full JSON Output:** The Azure CLI directly returns the data in JSON, which can then be parsed for additional processing.

#### **Cons:**
1. **Dependency on Azure CLI:** This approach requires the Azure CLI to be installed and authenticated (`az login`).
2. **Performance Overhead:** Parsing JSON output and converting it may introduce some performance overhead compared to native PowerShell objects.
3. **Potential Compatibility Issues:** The Azure CLI and PowerShell integration depend on how the JSON data is structured and handled.

### Azure Native PowerShell

#### **2. `Get-AzResource | Select-Object @{Name='id';Expression={$_.ResourceId}}`**

#### **What It Does:**
- Runs the PowerShell `Get-AzResource` cmdlet from the **Az PowerShell module**, which retrieves a list of Azure resources.
- Pipes the result to `Select-Object`, creating a custom property (`id`) that maps to the `ResourceId` property of each resource.

#### **Pros:**
1. **Native PowerShell Cmdlet:** `Get-AzResource` returns objects that are directly compatible with PowerShell, without requiring JSON conversion.
2. **Integrated Experience:** It's part of the **Az PowerShell module**, designed specifically for PowerShell users and better integrates into PowerShell scripts.
3. **Simpler Processing:** There's no need for `ConvertFrom-Json` or extra parsing since the output is already a PowerShell object.
4. **Better Performance:** Avoids the overhead of JSON serialization and deserialization.

#### **Cons:**
1. **Dependency on Az Module:** Requires the Az PowerShell module to be installed (`Install-Module -Name Az`).
2. **Platform Limitation:** The Az PowerShell module works best on Windows and PowerShell Core, but might not always work as smoothly on non-Windows systems.
3. **Less Control Over Output:** You don't get the fine-grained output customization (like JMESPath) that Azure CLI provides.

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature                     | `az resources list`                                  | `Get-AzResource`                                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Tool**                    | Azure CLI                                            | Az PowerShell Module                             |
| **Output Format**           | JSON (converted to PowerShell object)                | Native PowerShell object                         |
| **Query Language**          | JMESPath (via `--query`)                             | PowerShell Expressions                           |
| **Platform**                | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)               | PowerShell-native, best for Windows & PS Core   |
| **Performance**             | Slightly slower due to JSON parsing                  | Faster (no JSON serialization)                  |
| **Dependency**              | Requires Azure CLI                                   | Requires Az PowerShell Module                   |
| **Ease of Scripting**       | Suitable for scripts that work across multiple OSes  | Easier integration for native PowerShell scripts|

### **When to Use Each:**
1. **Use Azure CLI (`az resources list`)** if:
   - You're working in a multi-OS environment.
   - You need to use JMESPath queries for complex data filtering.
   - You're already familiar with Azure CLI.

2. **Use Az PowerShell (`Get-AzResource`)** if:
   - You're writing PowerShell scripts that need native PowerShell object manipulation.
   - You prefer PowerShell cmdlets for managing Azure resources.
   - You're looking for faster execution without JSON parsing overhead.

Both approaches are valid, and the choice depends on your environment, dependencies, and familiarity with the tools.
